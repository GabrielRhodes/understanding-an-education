            &emsp;&emsp;Welcome to Understanding an Education, a year-long study
            into how people learn, how schools operate, and how we can improve
            education, particularly in the United States. Understanding an
            Education is a passion project that I will be working on for the
            school year of 2022-2023 which will hopefully end with a fully
            fleshed out senior thesis. I look to combine interviews, polling,
            statistics, and expert opinion to play with the question of what
            schooling should look like. The goal is to contribute in a
            meaningful way to what we know about education as it exists today
            and what that should mean going forward.
          </p>

            &emsp;&emsp;Understanding an Education is an article writing project
            with the end goal of a complete senior thesis about education. Every
            piece will be backed up with extensive research, easy-to-navigate
            source sheets, and several data visuals. The hope is that you learn
            from everything you read so that you have a better understanding of
            education in the United States and the various systems affecting it.

            &emsp;&emsp;Understanding an Education is not a project conducted by
            one person though. Polling, interviews, statistics, and expertise
            are not things that I have any capacity to obtain on my own in a
            year. That's why if you wish to contribute, I am more than happy to
            have your assistance in this educational journey at any time. If you
            want to write an article, contribute by taking polls (or getting
            others to take them!), or become an interviewee, then please email
            understandinganeducation@gmail.com with how you'd like to
            contribute.
          </p>
          <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;I sincerely hope that you gain something from this
            project. If you have questions about anything, want to provide
            feedback, or just want to say hi, then feel free to use the email
            above whenever. Here's to the upcoming year!
