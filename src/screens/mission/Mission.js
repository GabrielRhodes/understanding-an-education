        <p>
          Education is a topic which appears to pop into the public eye every
          now and then without much rhyme or reason

          found what they learned to be helpful outside of the classroom

          . Understanding an Education looks to educate about education. Run by
          me, Gabriel Rhodes, I look to understand what education is, how it
          impacts society, and how it changes people. I do this by combining
          interviews, research, polls, and history to write articles on
          different subjects around the topic of education.

        <h2>Understanding Schooling in a Society</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding schools and their place in society is a vital part of
          how we educate the next generation. Schooling is the process we use to
          educate the majority of individuals, so it is vital that it work for
          the students it teaches. What knowledge we impart upon the next
          generation determines the world that they try to build. As such, it is
          vital that we, as a nation and as a world, know what schooling can and
          should be. Understanding an Education looks to understand the greater
          societal impacts and investments of education.
